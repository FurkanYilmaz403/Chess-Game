# Chess-Game
My first game. I tried to create a chess game.
I build chess with C++ and SFML library. It took my nearly 8 days. The game is a 2 player game, there is no AI, and white starts below, black starts above.
Unlike other small chess projects it shows the places you can move or the pieces you can take. It won't check for checkmate or draw. I tried it myself
for so many times but there can still be issues. There is one issue I could see, that clicking pieces one after another may sometimes have a problem
showing possible moves. But clicking 2 times solve this problem so I did not get bothered for that. This is all.
